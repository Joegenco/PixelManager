This is not a full readme. That is coming soonâ„¢

Tested with "Blender 4.5+, Maya 2023+, Nuke 15+, Fusion 18.5+, Substance 2025 and more...

## How to edit "Colorspaces" visible to users (Inactive Colorspaces)
To be able to see and utilize more colorspaces, open `config.ocio` file
then go to **line 296** and enable of the `inactive colorspaces` by removing the comment (`#`). Use the default `Minimal` preset as an example.

Only one `inactive_colorspaces` line can be active at a time.

#### Avalilabe presets: 
 - `Minimal`: Inactive spaces with absolute minimal clutter
 - `CG`: Inactive spaces with STORAGE log formats visible
 - `STUDIO`: Inactive spaces with CAMERA log formats visible to the user
 - `Minimal-Comp-Grading (Mainly for Blender) sRGB`: All but sRGB image formation inactive. No camera LOG spaces visible. Useful when forming images in compositor (For sRGB displays)
- `STUDIO-Comp-Grading (Mainly for Blender) sRGB` : All but sRGB image formation inactive. Camera LOG spaces are visible. Useful when forming images in compositor (For sRGB displays)

*If youre using it with **Fusion**, comment out all of them as Fusion hides all*
